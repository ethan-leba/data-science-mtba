    "The MBTA is a very old public transport system, and as a result of that age, some cracks have begun to show. Public transit is a very important service for many commuters who do not own cars, and because of that, improving public transit can make a direct improvement on many peopleâ€™s lives. For our project, we want to take a look at what exactly the flaws are in the train system, and what can be done to fix it. Since our datasets include information about wait times, ridership count, rider satisfaction, and many specifics about the train lines themselves, we will do this by examining how these factors affect the overall satisfaction with the MBTA, and how different train lines vary in their quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions we have formulated regarding are dataset are as follows:\n",
    "* Which trains have a significant difference in average arrival delays?\n",
    "* How does customer satisfaction vary with the number of riders, and type of transport? (and assuming it is affected by those, What could we suggest for the MBTA to do to increase satisfaction?)\n",
    "* How does the MBTA fare increase affect customer satisfaction and ridership?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses we have formulated regarding are dataset are as follows:\n",
    "* Long arrival delays negatively affect customer satisfaction.\n",
    "* Congestion negatively affect customer satisfaction.\n",
    "* Increased MBTA fare lowers the ridership.\n",
    "* Data Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our variables, we were hoping to see and possibly predict where some problematic areas of the MBTA system may be. One of the key areas we were hoping to investigate would be the wait times and to see how they have been changing over time. This coupled with customer satisfaction and fare rate could help us determine which areas are prime targets for upgrade/fixes in the future. Based off of that, we could also see if a price change would be needed in the near future by observing how drastic of a change in customer satisfaction is predicted by our model. \n",
    "We believe that machine learning could prove helpful when conducting our analysis. By using clustering techniques, we could if any train lines are particularly problematic and to see if we need to focus our analysis there. Using regression techniques, we could attempt to predict future problems that may not be easily observed using traditional statistical analysis. \n"
